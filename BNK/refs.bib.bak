  abstract = {This paper provides a survey on studies that analyze the macroeconomic
	effects of intellectual property rights (IPR). The first part of
	this paper introduces different patent policy instruments and reviews
	their effects on R\&D and economic growth. This part also discusses
	the distortionary effects and distributional consequences of IPR
	protection as well as empirical evidence on the effects of patent
	rights. Then, the second part considers the international aspects
	of IPR protection. In summary, this paper draws the following conclusions
	from the literature. Firstly, different patent policy instruments
	have different effects on R\&D and growth. Secondly, there is empirical
	evidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection
	and innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries
	than for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR
	protection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation
	against the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality.
	Finally, in an open economy, achieving the globally optimal level
	of protection requires an international coordination (rather than
	the harmonization) of IPR protection.},

	in the allocation of talent, what determines the reward structure
	of a society is an important question. This paper develops an equilibrium
	model of the allocation of talent between productive and unproductive
	activities (such as rent-seeking). The existence of rent-seeking
	creates a negative externality on productive agents and implies that
	relative rewards are endogenously determined. The same externality
	can also lead to the existence of multiple equilibria, each with
	different reward structures. In a dynamic setting, allocations of
	past generations as well as expectations of future allocations influence
	current rewards and the society may get trapped in a [`]rent-seeking'
	steady state equilibrium. The paper also discusses how the non-pecuniary
	reward structure can be influenced by equilibrium selection and a
	historical example that suggests the presence of a causal link from
	the allocation of talent to non-pecuniary rewards.},

	In this chapter, I survey the most recent contribution and assess

	can only be tested and estimated using a flexible specification of
	preferences and individual level data; (ii) it is possible to construct
	versions of the model that are not rejected by the data. One of the
	main problems of the approach used in the literature to estimate

	evidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection
	and innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries
	than for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR
	protection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation
	against the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality.
	Finally, in an open economy, achieving the globally optimal level
	of protection requires an international coordination (rather than
	the harmonization) of IPR protection.},

	models that give rise to indeterminate equilibria. The role of external
	effects, monopolistic competition, and increasing returns in generating
	indeterminacy is explored for one-sector and multi-sector models
	of real business cycles and of economic growth. Indeterminacy is
	also studied in monetary models, as well as in models where monetary
	and fiscal policy are endogenous and determined by feedback rules.
	Particular attention is paid to the empirical plausibility of these
	models and their parametrizations in generating indeterminate equilibria.
	An overview of calibrated macroeconomic models with sunspot equilibria
	is given, and their successes and shortcomings in matching properties
	of data are assessed. Finally some issues regarding the selection

	the 1980s. In open economies, pervasive skill-biased technological
	change (SBTC) can explain this decline. SBTC tends to increase the
	domestic supply of unskill-intensive goods by releasing less-skilled
	labor. The more countries experiencing a SBTC, the greater its potential
	to decrease the relative wages of less-skilled labor by increasing
	the world supply of unskill-intensive goods. We find strong evidence
	for pervasive SBTC in developed countries. Most industries increased
	the proportion of skilled workers despite generally rising or stable
	relative wages. Moreover, the same manufacturing industries simultaneously
	increased demand for skills in different countries. Many developing
	countries also show increased skill premiums, a pattern consistent
	with SBTC. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] },

	evidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection
	and innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries
	than for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR
	protection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation
	against the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality.
	Finally, in an open economy, achieving the globally optimal level
	of protection requires an international coordination (rather than
	the harmonization) of IPR protection.},

	authorities to influence the evolution of macroeconomic aggregates.
	This chapter surveys the historical experience of both international
	and domestic (national) aspects of monetary regimes from the nineteenth
	century to the present. We first survey the experience of four broad
	international monetary regimes: the classical gold standard 1880-1914;
	the interwar period in which a short-lived restoration of the gold
	standard prevailed; the postwar Bretton Woods international monetary
	system (1946-1971) indirectly linked to gold; the recent managed
	float period (1971-1995). We then present in some detail the institutional
	arrangements and policy actions of the Federal Reserve in the United
	States as an important example of a domestic policy regime. The survey
	of the Federal Reserve subdivides the demarcated broad international
	policy regimes into a number of episodes. A salient theme in our
	survey is that the convertibility rule or principle that dominated
	both domestic and international aspects of the monetary regime before
	World War I has since declined in its relevance. At the same time,
	policymakers within major nations placed more emphasis on stabilizing
	the real economy. Policy techniques and doctrine that developed under
	the pre-World War I convertible regime proved to be inadequate to
	deal with domestic stabilization goals in the interwar period, setting
	the stage for the Great Depression. In the post-World War II era,
	the complete abandonment of the convertibility principle, and its
	replacement by the goal of full employment, combined with the legacy
	of inadequate policy tools and theory from the interwar period, set
	the stage for the Great Inflation of the 1970s. The lessons from
	that experience have convinced monetary authorities to reemphasize
	the goal of low inflation, as it were, committing themselves to rule-like
	behavior.},

	to incorporate matching frictions in the labour market and a technology
	capable of yielding unbounded endogenous growth, we show that the
	cross-country bivariate correlation between unemployment and growth
	can be either positive or negative depending on the source of the
	differences in economic structures across countries. Amongst other
	results we note an 'anti-Kaldorian' property whereby an increase
	in the relative bargaining strength of workers which tends to reduce
	employment (and hence also the volume of savings), may nevertheless
	increase growth because the associated redistribution towards those
	who save (the young) produces an increase in the total volume of
	saving overall. We also present a two-sector variant of the model
	in which there is imperfect (Cournot) competition in consumption
	goods markets. A reduction in the propensity to save leads to an
	expansion in the market size for consumption goods, an increase in
	competition as new firms enter, and a fall in the relative price
	of consumption goods. This tends to expand employment. If entry costs
	into consumption goods production are sufficiently large this expansion
	in employment can be big enough to produce an increase in the total
	volume of saving even though the propensity to save has itself decreased.
	This 'Keynesian' result is in marked contrast to more 'Classical'
	results that are obtained when the same experiment is conducted in
	our earlier model.},

	performance. Finally, while the data indicate that more inflation

	diverse valuation methodologies, and a broader range of wetland services
	(e.g., biodiversity value). We also aim for a more comprehensive
	geographical coverage. We find that socio-economic variables, such
	as income and population density, that are often omitted from such
	analyses are important in explaining wetland value. We also assess
	the prospects for using this analysis for out-of-sample value transfer,

  abstract = {High and persistent inflation has been one of the distinguishing macroeconomic
	characteristics of many developing countries since the end of World
	War II. Countries afflicted by chronic inflation, however, have not
	taken their fate lightly and have engaged in repeated stabilization
	attempts. More often than not, stabilization plans have failed. The
	end of stabilizations -- particularly those which rely on a pegged
	exchange rate -- has often involved dramatic balance-of-payments
	crises. As stabilization plans come and go, a large literature has
	developed trying to document the main empirical regularities and
	to understand the key issues involved. This chapter undertakes a
	critical review and evaluation of the literature related to inflation
	stabilization policies and balance-of-payments crises in developing
	countries. The chapter begins by trying to rationalize the existence
	of chronic inflation in a world of rational agents. It then offers
	an empirical analysis of the main stylized facts associated with
	stopping chronic inflation. It is shown that the real effects of
	disinflation depend on the nominal anchor which is used. Exchange-rate-based
	stabilizations lead to an initial output and consumption boom --
	which is particularly evident in the behavior of durable goods --
	real exchange rate appreciation, and current account deficits. The
	contractionary costs typically associated with disinflation emerge
	only later in the program. In contrast, in money-based stabilizations,
	the contraction occurs in the beginning of the program. The chapter
	then proceeds to review several explanations for these puzzling phenomena,
	emphasizing the real effects of lack of credibility, inflation inertia,
	and consumption cycles generated by durable goods purchases. The
	chapter also documents the fact that most exchange-rate-based stabilizations
	end up in balance-of-payments crises. The Mexican crisis of December
	1994 brought back to life some of the key questions: Do exchange-rate-based
	stabilizations sow the seeds of their own destruction by unleashing
	#unsustainable# real exchange rate appreciations and current account
	deficits? Or are credibility problems and self-fulfilling prophecies
	at the root of these crises? The remainder of the chapter is devoted
	to analyzing the main ideas behind this unfolding literature.},

	to investment in innovation. Following Joseph Schumpeter, one view
	is that monopoly and large scale promote investment in research and
	development by allowing a firm to capture a larger fraction of its
	benefits and by providing a more stable platform for a firm to invest
	in R\&amp;D. Others argue that competition promotes innovation by
	increasing the cost to a firm that fails to innovate. This lecture
	surveys the literature at a level that is appropriate for an advanced
	undergraduate or graduate class and attempts to identify primary
	determinants of investment in R\&amp;D. Key issues are the extent
	of competition in product markets and in R\&amp;D, the degree of
	protection from imitators, and the dynamics of R\&amp;D competition.
	Competition in the product market using existing technologies increases
	the incentive to invest in R\&amp;D for inventions that are protected
	from imitators (e.g., by strong patent rights). Competition in R\&amp;D
	can speed the arrival of innovations. Without exclusive rights to
	an innovation, competition in the product market can reduce incentives
	to invest in R\&amp;D by reducing each innovator's payoff. There
	are many complications. Under some circumstances, a firm with market
	power has an incentive and ability to preempt rivals, and the dynamics
	of innovation competition can make it unprofitable for others to
	catch up to a firm that is ahead in an innovation race.},

	Assuming that preferences conform to two of the leading models of

	Prospect Theory (CPT)--we find strong evidence of moderate risk aversion.
	Once we include individual characteristics in the estimation of risk
	parameters, we observe that farmers use subjective nonlinear probability
	weighting, a behavior consistent with CPT. Interestingly, when we
	allow for preference heterogeneity via the estimation of mixture
	models--where the proportion of subjects who behave according to
	EUT or to CPT is endogenously determined--we find that the majority
	of farmers' choices are best explained by CPT. We further hypothesize
	that the multiple switching behavior observed in our sample can be
	explained by nonlinear probability weighting made in a context of
	large random calculation mistakes; the evidence found on this regard
	is mixed. Finally, we find that attaining higher education is the
	single most important individual characteristic correlated with risk
	preferences, a result that suggests a connection between cognitive

  abstract = {The present paper focuses on statistical models for estimating Human
	Capital (HC) at disaggregated level (worker, household, graduates).
	The more recent literature on HC as a latent variable states that
	HC can be reasonably considered a broader multi-dimensional non-observable
	construct, depending on several and interrelate causes, and indirectly
	measured by many observed indicators. In this perspective, latent
	variable models have been assuming a prominent role in the social
	science literature for the study of the interrelationships among
	phenomena. However, traditional estimation methods are prone to different
	limitations, as stringent distributional assumptions, improper solutions,
	and factor score indeterminacy for Covariance Structure Analysis
	and the lack of a global optimization procedure for the Partial Least
	Squares approach. To avoid these limitations, new approaches to structural
	equation modelling, based on Component Analysis, which estimates
	latent variables as exact linear combinations of observed variables
	minimizing a single criterion, were proposed in literature. However,
	these methods are limited to model particular types of relationship
	among sets of variables. In this paper, we propose a class of models
	in such a way that it enables to specify and fit a variety of relationships
	among latent variables and endogenous indicators. Specifically, we
	extend this new class of models to allow for covariate effects on
	the endogenous indicators. Finally, an application aimed to measure,
	in a realistic structural model, the causal impact of formal Human
	capital (HC), accumulated during Higher education, on the initial
	earnings for University of Milan (Italy) graduates is illustrated.},

	risks will be considered in the capital budgeting decisions of a
	managerial firm operated in the interests of its stockholders. This
	is in contrast to the implication of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory
	(a similar result follows from the Capital Asset Pricing Model) which

  abstract = {This chapter provides a survey of the recent work on learning in the
	context of macroeconomics. Learning has several roles. First, it
	provides a boundedly rational model of how rational expectations
	can be achieved. Secondly, learning acts as a selection device in
	models with multiple REE (rational expectations equilibria). Third,
	the learning dynamics themselves may be of interest. While there
	are various approaches to learning in macroeconomics, the emphasis
	here is on adaptive learning schemes in which agents use statistical
	or econometric techniques in self-referential stochastic systems.
	Careful attention is given to learning in models with multiple equilibria.
	The methodological tool is to set up the economic system under learning
	as a SRA (stochastic recursive algorithm) and to analyze convergence
	by the method of stochastic approximation based on an associated
	differential equation. Global stability, local stability and instability
	results for SRAs are presented. For a wide range of solutions to
	economic models the stability conditions for REE under statistical
	learning rules are given by the expectational stability principle,
	which is treated as a unifying principle for the results presented.
	Both linear and nonlinear economic models are considered and in the
	univariate linear case the full set of solutions is discussed. Applications
	include the Muth cobweb model, the Cagan model of inflation, asset
	pricing with risk neutrality, the overlapping generations model,
	the seignorage model of inflation, models with increasing social
	returns, IS-LM-Phillips curve models, the overlapping contract model,
	and the Real Business Cycle model. Particular attention is given
	to the local stability conditions for convergence when there are
	indeterminacies, bubbles, multiple steady states, cycles or sunspot
	solutions. The survey also discusses alternative approaches and recent
	developments, including Bayesian learning, eductive approaches, genetic
	algorithms, heterogeneity, misspecified models and experimental evidence.},

	the predictions of Sargent and Wallace\&apos;s \&ldquo;unpleasant

	typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing
	on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds
	strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing
	countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These
	results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections
	for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions,
	and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression
	to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses
	consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation.
	Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited
	by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive
	evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap
	is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based
	stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our
	findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors
	in the link between fiscal policy and inflation. IMF Staff Papers

	to investment in innovation. Following Joseph Schumpeter, one view
	is that monopoly and large scale promote investment in research and
	development by allowing a firm to capture a larger fraction of its
	benefits and by providing a more stable platform for a firm to invest
	in R\&amp;D. Others argue that competition promotes innovation by
	increasing the cost to a firm that fails to innovate. This lecture
	surveys the literature at a level that is appropriate for an advanced
	undergraduate or graduate class and attempts to identify primary
	determinants of investment in R\&amp;D. Key issues are the extent
	of competition in product markets and in R\&amp;D, the degree of
	protection from imitators, and the dynamics of R\&amp;D competition.
	Competition in the product market using existing technologies increases
	the incentive to invest in R\&amp;D for inventions that are protected
	from imitators (e.g., by strong patent rights). Competition in R\&amp;D
	can speed the arrival of innovations. Without exclusive rights to
	an innovation, competition in the product market can reduce incentives
	to invest in R\&amp;D by reducing each innovator's payoff. There
	are many complications. Under some circumstances, a firm with market
	power has an incentive and ability to preempt rivals, and the dynamics
	of innovation competition can make it unprofitable for others to
	catch up to a firm that is ahead in an innovation race.},

	The most important phenomenon to explain and understand in a recession
	is the sharp decline in employment and jump in unemployment. This
	chapter considers explanations based on frictions in the labor market.
	Earlier research within the real business cycle paradigm considered
	frictionless labor markets where fluctuations in the volume of work
	effort represented substitution by households between work in the
	market and activities at home. A preliminary section of the chapter
	discusses why frictionless models are incomplete -- they fail to
	account for either the magnitude or persistence of fluctuations in
	employment. And the frictionless models fail completely to describe
	unemployment. The evidence suggests strongly that consideration of
	unemployment as a third use of time is critical for a realistic model.
	The two elements of a theory of unemployment are a mechanism for
	workers to lose or leave their jobs and an explanation for the time
	required from them to find new jobs. Theories of mechanism design
	or of continuous re-bargaining of employment terms provide the first.
	The theory of job search together with efficiency wages and related
	issues provides the second. Modern macro models incorporating these
	features come much closer than their predecessors to realistic and
	rigorous explanations of the magnitude and persistence of fluctuations.},

	of economists is that they were able to witness the birth and the

	growth. The centerpiece of that approach is probably growth accounting,
	but they should never forget that growth accounting is firmly rooted
	in economic theory. The author's way of telling the story goes like
	this: Many, maybe even most, economists expected that increments
	of output would be explained by increments of inputs, but when they
	took their best shot they found that traditional inputs typically
	fell far short of explaining the observed output growth. Their best
	shot consisted in attributing to each factor a marginal product measured
	by its economic reward. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright of American

	to benefit more from long-term contracts in renegotiations than players

	to a long-term contract. Using data from the German â€œBundesliga\&quot;,

	into catch-up, technological change and factor accumulation effects
	and stochastic shocks. This decomposition is investigated separately
	in the agriculture sector and the economy as a whole using a balanced
	panel data set of 45 countries in different development stages during
	the time period 1967-1992. The impact of labor productivity change
	components on the evolution of the cross-country counterfactual distribution
	of labor productivity is also analyzed. For the overall economy,
	the empirical results indicate that growth and the twin-peak distribution
	of labor productivity are driven by capital deepening. However, the
	results for the agriculture sector suggest that labor productivity
	distribution is brought by total factor productivity changes rather
	than factor accumulation. Furthermore, the agriculture sector exhibits
	reductions in capital per worker as well as stronger catch-up and
	technological change effects. Thus, growth of the rest of the economy
	appears to owe more to capital deepening and resource reallocation
	from agriculture than to faster productivity change.},

	of economic growth and convergence rates among different countries.
	Research on convergence proceeded through several stages. In the
	first, convergence was studied under the implicit assumption that
	all countries of the sample had the same steady state levels of income,
	which later came to be known as absolute convergence. The second
	stage emphasized that the growth theory did not imply identical steady
	state levels of income for all countries and that, in studying convergence,
	these differences needed to be allowed. The assumption that all countries
	have identical production functions and differ only in the value
	of the variables of this function and not in its parameters was neither
	appealing nor tenable. In the third stage, this assumption of strict
	parametric homogeneity was relaxed, and, through the use of panel
	data methodology, the aggregate production function was allowed to

	evidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection
	and innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries
	than for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR
	protection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation
	against the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality.

	model applied to a variety of data on different learning experiments
	and experiences. The modeling produced three main findings. First,
	when the authors compare the estimation results for the twelve different
	learning processes, the following pattern emerges: processes on which
	learning is important, as measured by cumulative productivity growth,
	tend to have longer half-lives of learning, tend to be more complex
	and tend to give rise to more inequality in cohorts of learners.
	Second, and surprisingly, if decisionmakers see somewhat independent
	signals about the parameter that they seek to learn, the efficiencies
	among these agents can vary greatly. Third, if an activity is complex
	enough, the distribution of efficiencies among decisionmakers is
	predicted by the model to become skewed to the right. },

  abstract = {In this paper, I develop a measure of human capital stock that is
	similar to measuring physical capital by its replacement cost. This
	measure builds on measures of average educational attainment of the
	labour force. While it is far from an ideal measure, it is an interesting
	complement to the educational attainment series and other existing
	measures of human capital accumulation. In cross鈥揷ountry panel regressions,
	use of this measure of human capital accumulation yields a positive
	and significant, but relatively small (about ten per cent) elasticity
	with percapita GDP growth. Unlike physical capital, the stock of
	human capital as a share of GDP increases with GDP. This is consistent
	with the Barro et al. (1995) model of growth with non鈥搈obile human
	capital and with some predictions of Romer鈥檚 (1990) model of endogenous
	growth, but it is not consistent with the predictions of some other

	bias in technical progress. The article considers the effects of
	improvements in technical progress in different sectors on distributive
	shares. In more simple models of technical progress it has been apparent
	that technical progress in the capital sector has had a tendency
	to increase labor's share, and it will be reassuring to confirm this
	result in the more complicated multisectoral model. The simplest
	procedure for tackling this problem is to suppose that in the initial
	situation no technical progress is taking place in any sector. This
	does not imply that there are no innovation possibility functions,
	but rather that in every sector the innovation possibility function
	passes through the origin. Distributive shares in each sector are
	still determined by the characteristics of the innovation possibility
	function even though no technical progress is actually taking place.

	technology shocks to produce realistic business cycles. While Solow
	residuals are sufficiently volatile, these imply frequent technological
	regress. Productivity studies permitting unobserved factor variation
	find much smaller technology shocks, suggesting the imminent demise

	utilization yields realistic business cycles from small, nonnegative

	from the literature. Firstly, different patent policy instruments
	have different effects on R\&D and growth. Secondly, there is empirical
	evidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection
	and innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries
	than for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR
	protection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation
	against the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality.
	Finally, in an open economy, achieving the globally optimal level
	of protection requires an international coordination (rather than
	the harmonization) of IPR protection.},

	role of financial sector development, with a view to deepening understanding
	of the rationale of development assistance to the financial sector

	conclusions: (i) there are convincing arguments that financial sector
	development plays a vital role in facilitating economic growth and
	poverty reduction, and these arguments are supported by overwhelming
	empirical evidence from both cross-country and countryspecific studies;
	(ii) there are however disagreements over how financial sector development
	should be sequenced in developing countries, particularly the relative
	importance of domestic banks and capital markets and, in developing
	the banking sector, the relative importance of large and small banks;
	(iii) while broadening the access to finance by microenterprises,
	small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and vulnerable groups
	is recognized as critically important for poverty reduction, it is
	also widely believed that microfinance and SME credit programs need
	to be well designed and targeted to be effective. In particular,
	these programs need to be accompanied by other support services such
	as provision of training and capacity building, assistance in accessing
	markets and technologies, and addressing other market failures; and
	(iv) financial sector development and innovation will bring risks,
	and it is therefore essential to maintain sound macroeconomic management,
	put in place effective regulatory and supervisory mechanisms, and
	carry out structural reforms in developing the financial sector.
	The paper argues that these conclusions provide a strong justification
	for development assistance to target financial sector development
	as a priority area, and that, like any public sector intervention,
	such assistance should be designed to address market and nonmarket
	failures. The paper also highlights several areas where more research

	-- with the most prominent contenders including price level, nominal
	income, and hybrid (inflation plus output gap) variables -- together
	with the issue of growth-rate vs. growing-level target path specifications.
	One conclusion is that inflation and nominal income growth targets,
	but not the hybrid target, would have induced fairly similar policy
	responses in the US economy over 1960-1995. With regard to instrument
	choice, the chapter argues that both nominal interest rate and monetary
	base measures are feasible; this discussion emphasizes the basic
	conceptual distinction between nominal indeterminacy and solution
	multiplicity. Accordingly, root-mean-square-error performance measures
	are estimated for interest rate and base instruments (with nominal
	income target) in the context of a VAR model. Other topics emphasized
	in the chapter include the operationality of policy-rule specifications;
	stochastic vs. historical simulation procedures; interactions between
	monetary and fiscal policies; and the recently-developed fiscal theory

	of search and matching equilibrium and derives the properties of
	employment and unemployment equilibrium. Second, it applies the model
	to the study of employment fluctuations and to the explanation of
	differences in unemployment rates in industrialized countries. The
	search and matching model is built on the assumptions of a time-consuming
	matching technology that determines the rate of job creation given
	the unmatched number of workers and jobs; and on a stochastic arrival
	of idiosyncratic shocks that determines the rate of job destruction
	given the wage contract between matched firms and workers. The outcome
	is a model for the flow of new jobs and unemployed workers from inactivity
	to production (the [`]job creation' flow) and one for the flow of
	workers from employment to unemployment and of jobs out of the market
	(the [`]job destruction' flow). Steady-state equilibrium is at the
	point where the two flows are equal. The model is shown to explain
	well the employment fluctuations observed in the US economy, within
	the context of a real business cycle model. It is also shown that
	the large differences in unemployment rates observed in industrialized
	countries can be attributed to a large extent to differences in policy
	towards employment protection legislation (which increases the duration
	of unemployment and reduces the flow into unemployment) and the generosity
	of the welfare state (which reduces job creation). It is argued that
	on the whole European countries have been more generous in their
	unemployment support policies and in their employment protection
	legislation than the USA. The chapter also surveys other reasons
	given in the literature for the observed levels in unemployment,
	including mismatch and real interest rates.},

	and optimal design of monetary institutions. Part II deals with fiscal
	policy in a dynamic general equilibrium set up: the main topics here
	are credibility of tax policy, and political determinants of budget

  abstract = {Abstract: A new econometric approach to testing for economic growth
	convergence is overviewed. The method is applicable to panel data,
	involves a simple regression based one-sided t-test, and can be used
	to form a clustering algorithm to assess the existence of growth
	convergence clubs. The approach allows for heterogeneous technology,
	utilizes some new asymptotic theory for nonlinear dynamic factor
	models, and is easy to implement. Some background growth theory is
	given which shows the form of augmented Solow regression (ASR) equations
	in the presence of heterogeneous technology and explains sources
	of potential misspecification that can arise in conventional formulations
	of ASR equations that are used to analyze growth convergence and
	growth determinants. A short empirical application is given illustrating
	some aspects of the methodology involving technological heterogeneity
	and learning in growth patterns for selected groups of countries.

	are quite persistent, even conditional on sales. To consider explanations
	for the two facts, we present a linear-quadratic model. The model
	can rationalize the two facts in a number of ways, but two stylized
	explanations have the virtue of relative simplicity and support from
	a number of papers. Both assume that there are persistent shocks
	to demand for the good in question, and that marginal production
	cost slopes up. The first explanation assumes as well that there
	are highly persistent shocks to the cost of production. The second
	assumes that there are strong costs of adjusting production and a
	strong accelerator motive. Research to date, however, has not reached
	a consensus on whether one of these two, or some third, alternative
	provides a satisfactory explanation of inventory behavior. We suggest
	several directions for future research that promise to improve our

	evidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection
	and innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries
	than for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR
	protection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation
	against the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality.
	Finally, in an open economy, achieving the globally optimal level
	of protection requires an international coordination (rather than

	from intentional investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents.
	The distinguishing feature of the technology as an input is that
	it is neither a conventional good nor a public good; it is a non-
	rival, partially' excludable good. Because of the nonconvexity introduced
	by a non-rival good. price-taking competition cannot be supported.
	Instead, the equilibrium is one with monopolistic competition. The
	main conclusions are that the stock of human capital determines the
	rate of growl h. that too little human capital is devoted to research
	in equilibrium, that integration into world markets will increase
	growth rates, and that having a large population is not sufficient

  abstract = {Because inputs are scarce, marginal cost is an increasing function
	of output. Diminishing returns, costs of increasing employment as
	well as the increasing marginal disutility of working when hours
	worked and effort rise all contribute to make this function steep.
	Without changes in this function relating marginal cost to output,
	aggregate output can vary if and only if the markup of price to marginal
	cost (the inverse of real marginal cost for typical firms) varies.
	We first study whether, empirically, real marginal cost does rise
	in cyclical expansions. Average real labor cost is not very procyclical
	but, for several reasons, marginal labor cost is more procyclical
	than average labor cost. These include the presence of overhead labor
	and adjustment costs as well as differences between the marginal
	and the average wage. These corrections results in procyclical measures
	of real marginal cost. Measures of marginal costs based on materials
	costs and inventories also appear procyclical. We show that these
	procyclical movements in marginal cost may, depending on how costs
	are modeled, account for a substantial fraction of cyclical output
	movements. Finally, we survey models of variable markups. These include
	both models of sticky prices (in which markups vary because firms
	cannot all costlessly charge the markup they desire) and models in
	which firms' desired markup varies over time. This set of models
	allows a rich set of variables to affect output even if these variables
	do not shift the marginal cost schedule.},

  abstract = {This volume examines the economic aspects of demographic changes occurring
	in the world fertility, mortality, and labor force behavior. Emphasis
	is on microeconomic concepts of personal productivity, longevity,
	and reproductivity. Thus, the economic and demographic processes
	that receive the most attention are market labor force participation
	and hours of work, mortality, and fertility. The volume's 2nd chapter
	provides an historical perspective on the current era of demographic
	transition and technological change. The Malthusian framework of
	economic-demographic equilibrium has influenced considerably how
	people think about population growth. By considering this closed
	micro-macro model it is possible to see both the genius and the limitations
	of the grand design of Classical Economics. Recent studies of preindustrial
	England suggest several aspects of Malthus's model that are in need
	of modification. The following chapter surveys the demographic dimensions
	of the world's modern development and demographic transition, i.e.,
	the decline in mortality that has been followed in some instances
	by a decline in fertility. The developing countries of Taiwan and
	Colombia are reviewed in some detail. The technical and structural
	change that underlies modern economic growth often appears to swamp
	the magnitude of long-run propensities of population growth and diminishing
	returns, the 2 pivotal concepts in Malthus's formulation. The 4th
	chapter begins with standard consumer demand theory, extending it
	in directions that are more suitable for the study of household long-run
	economic and demographic behavior. The labor-leisure choice framework
	is modified to treat the variety of nonmarket activities occurring
	in the household that combine market goods and time to produce final
	consumption commodities. Problems are discussed in applying this
	framework to choices made by families and to infer the value of time
	of family members who are not in the wage labor force. This chapter
	provides analytical tools that are useful for economics of population.
	Describing what is known about the origins of recent mortality declines
	and their consequences on fertility, the 5th chapter considers the
	causal structure of the demographic transition. The subsequent chapter
	explores alternative microeconomic approaches to fertility determination
	and their implications for population "quality" and policies. The
	final 2 chapters use the demand framework to interpret patterns of
	labor force participation and hours worked of women and men and reinterates
	and projects several themes of the book.},

	in explaining of the dynamic relationship between money, real output,
	and inflation. The key properties to be explained are that monetary
	shocks have persistent, but not permanent, effects on real output,
	and that the correlation between current output and inflation is
	positive for leads of inflation and negative for lags of inflation.
	The paper begins with a short empirical guide to price- and wage-setting
	behavior in market economies. It then compares alternative price-
	and wage-setting theories and argues that staggered contracts models
	continue to provide the most satisfactory match with the key macroeconomic
	facts. It then examines the microeconomic foundations of staggered
	contracts models and reviews some of their extensions and applications.
	Research in this area has been very active in the 1990s with a remarkable
	number of studies using, estimating, or testing models of staggered
	price and wage setting. A new generation of econometric models incorporating
	staggered price and wage setting with rational expectations has been
	built. Researchers have begun to incorporate staggered wage and price
	setting into real business cycle models. Close links have been discovered
	between the parameters of people's utility functions and the parameters
	of staggered price- and wage-setting equations. There is now a debate
	about whether standard calibrations of utility functions prevent
	staggered prace models, at least those with frequent price changes,
	from explaining long persistence of real output. A theme of the paper
	is that the advent of rational expectations in the 1970s led to models
	of price and wage rigidities which were more amenable to empirical
	testing than earlier models, and this is one reason for the recent
	controversies and debates. There is much to be discovered from these
	debates and from the future research they stimulate.},

	the Caldwell hypothesis reexamined},
  journal = {Population and Development Review},
  year = {1982},
  volume = {8, Supplement},
  pages = {207-234},
  abstract = {In explaining the demographic transition, Caldwell, in a series of
	papers, has given singular importance to a change in the direction
	of intrafamily intergenerational transfers and an associated shift
	in parental motivations to bear and rear children from economic to
	psychic advantages, which accompanies socioeconomic development and
	modernization. In 2 recent papers this author initiated a longterm
	project with the goal of constructing an economic theory of the demographic
	transition. Early work on this project has several parallels with
	Caldwell's theory and with an independent statement of a similar
	view by Ryder. The work also emphasized the connection between fertility
	and the intergenerational distribution of income and consumption
	within the family and attempts to trace the mechanisms by which socioeconomic
	development may lead to fertility transition. This paper represents
	both a summary and extension of the recent work and related theoretical
	literature with emphasis on its application to demographic transition
	theory. The main substantive conclusions follow from the assumption
	that modern economic development is driven by sustained technological
	change that is translated into growth in real income via investments
	in human and physical capital. At a given rate of population growth,
	a rise in the productivity of human and physical capital due to improved
	technology increases the mean age at which it is optimal for an individual
	to produce his/her lifetime wealth relative to the age at which lifetime
	wealth is consumed, in steady state. This, in turn, tends to shift
	the steady state direction of net intergenerational transfers from
	a situation in which the young transfer to the old under primitive
	technological conditions to a situation in which the old transfer
	to the young with more advanced technology. In the former case a
	rise in population growth increases per capita wealth and welfare,
	and in the latter case it reduces them. The author concludes his
	reexamination of the Caldwell hypothesis by advancing an alternative
	version that reverses the line of causation that he emphasizes and,
	instead, emphasizes the crucial role that the family and, particularly,
	parental altruism plays in the process of economic development. A
	purely self interested older generation refuses to reduce its consumption
	either directly of indirecly via intermediary institutions that operate
	in impersonal private markets because the benefits of the investment
	are reaped by the younger generation after the older generation is
	dead. On the other hand, an older generation of altruistic parents
	considers the success of their sons and daughters as a substitute
	for their own success.},

  abstract = {A review of the measures of the stock of human capital used in empirical
	growth research – including adult literacy rates, school enrollment
	ratios, and average years of schooling of the working-age population

	use of the most common proxy, average years of schooling, misspecifies
	the relationship between education and the stock of human capital.
	Based on human capital theory, the specification of human capital
	is extended to allow for decreasing returns to education and for
	differences in the quality of a year of education. The different
	specifications give rise to hugely differing measures of the stock

	Tables over the period 1950 to 1990 was used. Five sources are used
	for educational data. The descriptive statistics suggest that the
	convergence in labor productivity levels among these nations appears
	to correspond to their convergence in schooling levels. However,
	econometric results showing a positive and significant effect of
	formal education on productivity growth among OECD countries are
	spotty at best. With only one or two exceptions, educational levels,
	the growth in educational attainment, and interaction effects between
	schooling and R&D were not found to be significant determinants of

	Conventional wisdom and the theoretical predictions of models of

	the growth of the market has indeed led to an increased R & D effort

	rates. Drawing on the remarkable insights of the museum curator Seabury
	C. Gilfillan, this paper modifies models of endogenous innovation
