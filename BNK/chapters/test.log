I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

I suspect you have forgotten a `}', causing me

I'll try to recover; but if the error is serious,
you'd better type `E' or `X' now and fix your file.
